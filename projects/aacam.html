					<p>Anything Also Cam turns your phone/tablet into a webcam for your Linux machine. You can use it with video chat programs such as Discord.</p>
					<p>This is a lot like <a href="https://www.dev47apps.com/">DroidCam</a>, but free and libre software, runs on Linux, and doesn't just work with Android -- it works with any device that can run a Chromium browser!</p>
					<p>However, this is still alpha software. It does not yet work with Windows or Mac, and it may have issues with some chat programs such as Telegram.</p>

					<h3>Downloads</h3>
					<p>There aren't any distros that package this yet, but I might try to get it on Fedora. In the meantime, you can compile from source.</p>
					<p>Get the source tarball (<a href="/static/release/aacam-v0.2.0a.tar.gz">v0.2.0a</a>, <a href="/static/release/aacam-v0.1.0a.tar.gz">v0.1.0a</a>) or clone the git repo: <span class="code">git clone https://limdingwen.me/git/aacam.git</span></p>
